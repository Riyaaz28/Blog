     <center><i>The Volvo XC90 is a mid-size luxury SUV manufactured and marketed by Volvo Cars since 2002 and now in its second generation.</i></center>
        <p align="justify"><font size="+2">The first generation was introduced at the 2002 North American International Auto Show and used the Volvo P2 platform shared with the first generation Volvo S80 and other large Volvo cars. It was manufactured at Volvo's Torslandaverken. Volvo moved production equipment of the first generation to China and ended Swedish production at the end of 2014, renaming the car as the Volvo XC Classic (or Volvo XC90 Classic).
At the end of 2014, the second generation XC90 was introduced. It is based on a new global platform, the Scalable Product Architecture . Both generations of the XC90 have won Motor Trend's SUV of the Year award in their debuts.</p></font>

      <p align="justify"><font size="+1">In January 2001, Volvo débuted its Adventure Concept Car at the North American International Auto Show, to gauge reaction to the styling and features of its upcoming SUV.In November 2001, Volvo released a teaser image showing the frontal styling of the production version, named the XC90. Notable as Volvo's first SUV model, the styling of the XC90 recalled the concept.In January 2002, the full XC90 unveiling occurred, at the North American International Auto Show.[10] Production began in August 2002, after Volvo's traditional mid-year shutdown, with the first XC90s coming out of the Torslanda factory in Sweden.

 At its North American launch for the 2003 model year, the XC90 was presented with a choice of two trim levels, the 2.5 T and the T6. The 2.5 T was the entry level version and offered a 2.5-litre B5254T2 "T5" turbocharged inline-five engine, producing 208 hp (155 kW) and 236 lb⋅ft (320 N⋅m) mated to an Aisin co-developed five-speed AW55-50/51 automatic. The T6 offered a 2.9-litre B6294T twin-turbocharged inline-six with 268 hp (200 kW) and 280 lb⋅ft (380 N⋅m) mated to a GM-sourced, Volvo-modified four-speed 4T65EV/GT automatic. While the 2.5T came standard with front-wheel drive, a Haldex Traction all-wheel drive (AWD) system was optional. The T6 was offered only with the AWD system.
        
A Yamaha V8 engine was added in 2005. This 4.4-litre Volvo B8444S engine produces 232 kW (315 PS; 311 hp) and 325 lb⋅ft (441 N⋅m) of torque.Volvo sold just over 40,000 XC90 units in North America that year.
        
The XC90 won the North American Car of the Year award and Motor Trend magazine's Sport/Utility of the Year for 2003.
        
Jeremy Clarkson, ex-host of Top Gear, has previously owned three XC90s,[13] and claims they were designed by "someone who must've had children due to its practicality."</p>
